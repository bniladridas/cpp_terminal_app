# Llama C++ Terminal Application

## Overview
This application is a terminal-based interface for interacting with the Llama model.

## CPU Usage Calculation
### Using getrusage
The code uses the `getrusage` function from the `<sys/resource.h>` library to retrieve resource usage statistics for the calling process. The function populates a `rusage` structure that contains various resource usage metrics, including user time and system time.

Here's how it's done in the code:
```cpp
struct rusage usage;
getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF, &usage);
double cpu_usage = (usage.ru_utime.tv_sec + usage.ru_stime.tv_sec) * 1000.0 +
                   (usage.ru_utime.tv_usec + usage.ru_stime.tv_usec) / 1000.0;
```
- `ru_utime` and `ru_stime` provide the user and system CPU time, respectively.
- The total CPU time is calculated by converting seconds and microseconds into milliseconds.

## GPU Usage Calculation
### Placeholder for GPU Usage
The code currently contains a placeholder for GPU usage, represented as:
```cpp
int gpu_usage = 0;  // Replace with actual GPU usage logic if available
```
This means that the actual logic to calculate GPU usage is not implemented in the current version of the code. In a complete implementation, you would typically use specific GPU libraries or APIs (like CUDA or OpenCL) to query the GPU for its current utilization.

### Summary
- **CPU Usage**: Calculated using `getrusage` to retrieve the amount of CPU time consumed by the process.
- **GPU Usage**: Currently set to a placeholder value (0%), indicating that there is no active logic to measure GPU usage in the provided code.

If you want to implement actual GPU usage measurement, you would need to integrate calls to a GPU monitoring library or API that provides this information.

## Llama Model Implementation

### Overview
The Llama model is a state-of-the-art language model designed for various natural language processing tasks. This section provides an in-depth look at how the Llama model is integrated into the C++ terminal application.

## Llama Model Details

The application utilizes the Llama 3.2 model, which is designed for advanced natural language processing tasks. This model is capable of generating human-like text based on the prompts provided by the user. The Llama model is known for its performance in various NLP applications, including chatbots, content generation, and more.

The Llama 3.2 model is a specific variant of the Llama model family, which is trained on a large corpus of text data. This model is fine-tuned for tasks such as conversational dialogue, text summarization, and language translation. The Llama 3.2 model has 3.2 billion parameters, which allows it to capture complex patterns and relationships in language.

### Architecture
The Llama model is based on a transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network designed primarily for sequence-to-sequence tasks. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder, both of which are composed of multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.

### Training
The Llama model is trained on a large corpus of text data, which is used to fine-tune the model's parameters. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output.

### Initialization
The Llama model is initialized through the `LlamaStack` class, which handles the API interactions and manages the model's lifecycle. The initialization process includes setting up the necessary parameters, such as whether to use the GPU for processing.

```cpp
LlamaStack llama(true); // Initialize with GPU usage
```

### Sending Requests
To interact with the Llama model, a prompt is constructed based on user input. The prompt is formatted to guide the model in generating appropriate responses.

```cpp
std::string prompt = "You are a highly knowledgeable and friendly AI assistant. Please provide clear, concise, and engaging answers.\n\nUser: " + user_message + "\nAssistant:";
```

### Processing Responses
The application sends the constructed prompt to the Llama model using the `completion` method of the `LlamaStack` class. This method handles the HTTP request to the model's API and retrieves the generated response.

```cpp
std::string response = llama.completion(prompt);
```

### Error Handling
The implementation includes error handling to manage potential issues during the API call, such as connection errors or timeouts. This ensures that the application can gracefully handle errors and provide feedback to the user.

### Resource Management
The application monitors resource usage, including CPU and GPU utilization, to provide insights into performance. This is achieved using system calls to retrieve usage statistics.

### Example Interaction
Here's an example of how the interaction with the Llama model looks in practice:

## Recent Updates

### Logging Enhancements
To better understand the data received during execution, logging statements have been added to the `main.cpp` file. These logs capture:
- The input prompt before sending it to the server.
- The JSON payload being sent.
- The response received from the server.

### Issue Resolution
An issue was identified where an invalid character in the JSON payload caused errors during execution. This was resolved by properly escaping newline characters in the payload. The application is now functioning correctly, and responses are generated as expected.

## Code Explanation
### Start Time
The start time is recorded just before the Llama model processes the input:
```cpp
auto start_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
```
### Processing the Input
The model processes the input, and this is where the time taken for the operation is measured:
```cpp
std::string response = llama.completion(prompt);
```
### End Time
The end time is recorded immediately after the processing is complete:
```cpp
auto end_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();
```
### Calculating Duration
The duration is then calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time:
```cpp
std::chrono::duration<double> duration = end_time - start_time;
```
### Outputting Duration
Finally, the duration is outputted in seconds:
```cpp
std::cout << "Duration: " << duration.count() << " seconds" << std::endl;
```

### Summary
The duration is measured in seconds using `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`, which provides precise timing. The difference between the end time and start time gives the total time taken for the model to process the input.
